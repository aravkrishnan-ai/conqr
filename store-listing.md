## Short Description (80 chars max - Play Store)
Run, walk, or ride to claim real-world territory. Compete with friends on a map.

## Full Description (App Store & Play Store)

Turn every run, walk, and ride into a battle for territory.

Conqr is a location-based fitness game that transforms your outdoor activities into a real-world territory war. Track your route, close your loop, and the area inside becomes YOUR territory on the map — visible to every player.

HOW IT WORKS
- Start an activity: choose Walk, Run, or Ride
- Your GPS path is tracked in real time on the map
- Close your loop by returning to your starting point
- The enclosed area becomes your claimed territory
- Other players can invade your territory by overlapping it with their own routes

FEATURES
- Real-time GPS tracking with live pace, distance, and duration stats
- Territory claiming with automatic polygon detection
- Territory invasion system — compete for map dominance
- Global and time-based leaderboards (weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Social feed to share activities and achievements
- Friend system with in-app friend requests
- Organized event mode for competitive group sessions
- Share cards for activities, territories, and leaderboard rankings
- Offline-first design — activities sync when you're back online

GET MOVING, GET CONQUERING
Whether you're a casual walker or a competitive runner, Conqr gives you a reason to explore new routes, push your limits, and defend your turf. Every step counts.
